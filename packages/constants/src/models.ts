/**
 * Model release dates, keyed by frontend display name (YYYY-MM-DD, UTC).

 * **This is the only release-date table in the repo, and it must stay that way.**

 * is the wrong home for them: a date that captions a diagram is the same fact as
 * a date that anchors a revenue axis, and two copies of one fact drift. Callers
 * go through `getModelReleaseDate`.
 *
 * **What the date means:** the day the weights became publicly downloadable — not
 * the announcement, and not the day InferenceX started benchmarking the model.
 * Inference optimisation cannot begin before the weights are out, so that
 * publication is the honest zero for any "how far has this come since it
 * shipped?" axis. Where a display name groups point releases (`GLM-5` covers
 * both GLM-5 and GLM-5.1), the date is the *earliest* release in the bucket,
 * because that is when the bucket's weights first existed.
 *
 * A date here must never postdate the model's first InferenceX sweep — a model
 * cannot be benchmarked before it exists. That is the check that catches a wrong
 * entry, and it is why these are worth sourcing individually rather than
 * defaulting to whatever `MODELS.md` lists as the date the model was added.
 *
 * Only add an entry you can source, and cite the source in a comment.
 * `getModelReleaseDate` returns null otherwise, so callers fall back to the
 * earliest date they actually have data for.
