/**
 * Pure fleet lifecycle math — no React, no 'use client'.
 *
 * `fleet.ts` answers "what does this fleet earn and cost per hour, right now?".
 * This answers "what has it earned and cost since the model shipped?" — and the
 * shape of that answer is measured, not assumed.
 *
 * A fixed fleet's revenue is not flat. The chips do not change, but the software
 * serving them does: over the months after a model's release, sweeps find better
 * configs, and each one raises the tokens the same hardware delivers at the same
 * interactivity. MI355X on DeepSeek-V4-Pro is the clearest example — an FP8
 * baseline, then FP4 with graphs and FlashMLA, then AITER GEMMs and Triton SWA,
 * then fused kernels — each step lifting the frontier.

 *   revenue │              ,──── each config rolls out to its own numbers

 *   ────────┼──╱──────────────────────────────  cost: flat, the racks
 *           │ ╱ the first config rolls out from zero
 *           └──────────────────────────────────▶  months since model release
 *
 * A config does not take effect the instant a sweep finds it: it is rolled out.
 * So every config gets its own ramp, climbing from whatever the fleet was already
 * serving to that config's numbers. The first config climbs from zero — nothing is
 * being served before it lands.
 *
 * Cost is constant throughout, so the gap between the lines is the return on
 * software progress, which is the thing no single benchmark date can show.
 *
 * Three conventions worth stating:
 *
 * 1. **Cost is flat, including through every rollout.** It is `chips x $/chip/hr`,
 *    and neither term moves when a config rolls out — racks bill from the moment
 *    they are energised, not from the moment they are loaded. So the first rollout
 *    is paid for in full while it earns its way up from zero, which is what puts
 *    the opening months below the rule and gives payback its meaning.
 * 2. **The ramp is an assumption; the steps are not.** Ramp length is a user
 *    input, defaulting to half a month, and it applies to every rollout.
 *    Which configs exist, when, and how fast they ran are all measured.
 * 3. **Interrupts are an availability haircut, not drawn events.** A 24-day MTBI
 *    over a multi-year window is thousands of events, each far under a pixel, so
 *    drawing them is aliasing noise. They scale revenue instead.
 *
 * The lifecycle assumptions here (price, ramp, MTBI, recovery, horizon) are user
 * inputs, and callers must present them as such. The throughput steps are not:
 * they are measured.
