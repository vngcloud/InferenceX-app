      'Weight-only quantization stores model weights in a low bit format such as 4 bit integers while keeping activations and arithmetic at higher precision, as in the W4A16 pattern.',
    explanation:
      'Weights are static and can be carefully quantized offline with methods such as GPTQ and AWQ, which choose scales and orderings that minimize quality loss. Activations are dynamic and harder to compress, so leaving them at 16 bits sidesteps their outlier problem. At serve time the kernel dequantizes weights on the fly, so memory traffic shrinks even though the multiply accumulate math itself does not get faster.',
    significance:
      'Because decode is memory bound, cutting weight bytes directly speeds up token generation and lets larger models fit on fewer chips. Weight-only methods made large open models runnable on modest hardware and remain the standard recipe when activation quantization would cost too much quality.',

    explanation:

Grouping values into blocks of around 16 or 32 elements and attaching a shared scale lets each block center the format on its own magnitude.

Triton raises the abstraction: the developer writes block level programs and the compiler handles memory coalescing, tiling, and scheduling. NVIDIA, AMD, and other vendors maintain backends, so one kernel source can target multiple architectures. Serving engines use it for fused operations, quantization paths, and MoE kernels where no vendor library fits.
