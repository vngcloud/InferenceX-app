/**
 * Per-run overrides and special cases for the ingest pipeline.
 *
 * Entries are enforced at ingest time. Changes merged to main or master are also applied
 * automatically to production by CI, followed by database verification, cache invalidation,
 * and cache warmup. Use `bun run db:apply-overrides` only for local preview or manual recovery.
 *
 * CONCLUSION_OVERRIDES — force the conclusion for a run (e.g. 'success' when
 *   the benchmark ran fine but CI failed on a non-benchmark step).
 *
 * PURGED_RUNS — runs to skip on ingest and delete from the DB,
 *   e.g. typically due to experimental runs or features which generate lots of broken data.
 *
 * PURGED_RUN_ATTEMPTS — purge only specific attempts of a run, leaving the others intact.
 *   Use this when a single attempt produced bad data but a later attempt is expected to succeed
 *   (or has already succeeded), so we can't nuke the entire run.
 *
 * PURGED_BENCHMARK_POINTS, purge individual benchmark rows from an otherwise valid
 * run attempt and skip them on every future ingest. Each entry uses the row's durable
 * database natural key, which can be queried from the linked dashboard point.
 *
 * CHANGELOG_BACKFILLS — correct stored changelog metadata for one exact run attempt
 * and base/head ref pair.
 *
 * BENCHMARK_POINT_BACKFILLS — correct metrics and/or offload identity for one exact
 * benchmark point. These are applied both during ingest and against existing DB rows.
 *
 * Note: GitHub deletes old workflow runs over time so these overrides may not be applicable forever,
 *       but we should keep them around for historical reference. You can find these on github (if available) by filling
 *       in the run id into the following link: https://github.com/SemiAnalysisAI/InferenceX/actions/runs/{run_id_here}
