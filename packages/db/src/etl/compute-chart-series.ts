/**
 * Bump when the extraction algorithm changes — backfill recomputes anything
 * older.
 *
 * v2: aggregate vllm gauges/counters across all engine series (was reading
 * only series[0], which under-counted by Nx on multi-engine DP/PP
 * deployments — most visible as a request-queue-depth chart that maxed out
 * at ~3 when the timeline clearly showed 20+ in-flight).
 *
 * v3: extract `prefixCacheHitsTps` so the detail page can derive cumulative
 * unique input tokens as cumsum(prefillTps - prefixCacheHitsTps).
 *
 * v4: extract sglang:* metrics too (fallback chain in each picker), so
 * SGLang runs populate the chart_series the same way vllm runs do.
 *
 * v5: map sglang:realtime_tokens (mode={prefill_cache,prefill_compute,decode})
 * into promptTokensBySource so the cumulative prompt-token-source-breakdown
 * chart shows useful splits for SGLang runs (filtered to prefill_* modes).
 *
 * v6: for SGLang, swap the coarse "prefill_cache" bucket for per-cache_source
 * breakdown from sglang:cached_tokens — current runs always have one
 * cache_source ("device" / HBM) but hicache (CPU offload) runs would
 * split into "device" + "host" automatically once ingested.
 *
 * v7: extract sglang:hicache_host_{used,total}_tokens into a new
 * hostKvCacheUsage series so the KV cache utilization chart can plot
 * the CPU offload pool's usage alongside the on-GPU HBM line.
 *
 * v8: keep the per-engine dimension on kv_cache_usage_perc as
 * `kvCacheUsageByEngine` (one entry per DP rank). The cluster-average
 * line hides load skew on DEP configs; the detail page overlays the
 * per-rank lines so a hot rank is visible at a glance.
 *
 * v9: retain orchestrator-normalized per-source series. Dynamo labels are
 * mapped to canonical router/prefill/decode roles, allowing the frontend to
 * inspect individual workers without interpreting Dynamo-native labels.
 *
 * v10: only emit per-source series for disaggregated configs with a recognized
 * orchestrator adapter. Non-disaggregated and unsupported configs retain the
 * existing aggregate-only behavior.
 *
 * v12: also consume the `warmup_metrics` block from the server-metrics blob and
 * merge its scrapes into the same series as the profiling `metrics` block.
 * Warmup and profiling timeslices carry their own absolute `start_ns` and never
 * overlap in time, so the merged series is continuous (warmup at lower t,
 * profiling after). This lets the agentic detail page slice `chart_series` into
 * warmup vs profiling at the request-derived boundary; older blobs without a
 * warmup block are unaffected. (v11 was a short-lived, since-reverted attempt to
 * carry kvCachePoolTokens in chart_series; that value now lives in
 * benchmark_results.metrics, derived from the server log — unrelated to this.)
 *
 * v13: give the KV-cache series a real per-engine identity instead of "one
 * entry per raw series". Three independent sources of duplication were
 * inflating `kvCacheUsageByEngine` (up to 8x — 64 lines for a run with 18
 * real engines) and fragmenting the cluster-average `kvCacheUsage`:
 *   1. v12's warmup merge concatenates each engine's warmup and profiling
 *      series, so every engine appeared at least twice — and single-engine
 *      deployments started drawing a spurious two-line "per-engine" overlay.
 *   2. vLLM run with multiple API-server frontends exposes the *same* engine
 *      set on every `/metrics` endpoint, so an 8-rank DP deployment scraped
 *      from two frontends yielded 16 series for 8 engines.
 *   3. Tensor-/pipeline-/expert-parallel ranks each report the one KV pool
 *      they share, so a TP8 worker looked like 8 engines holding identical
 *      values.
 * Series are now grouped by their Prometheus label set (see
 * `seriesIdentityKey`), and the cluster average is a real mean across those
 * logical engines (see `averageAcrossEngines`) rather than a mean over
 * whichever engines happened to share an exact `start_ns`.
 *
 * v14: give the SUMMED series the same treatment v13 gave the averaged one.
 * Components of a metric are not scraped in lockstep — a disaggregated run
 * puts every worker on its own `/metrics` endpoint and its own sub-second
 * offset, and even a single-endpoint SGLang run splits its token counters into
 * `is_streaming="true"`/`"false"` series ~16 ms apart — so summing on an exact
 * `start_ns` emitted one point per component per tick, each carrying that
 * component's share alone instead of the cluster total. The detail page reads
 * those as a comb: `rollingAverage` is a sample-count mean, so it averaged the
 * real samples together with the other components' structural gaps and drew
 * roughly 1/N of the actual throughput (measured: 2.2x low on an 8-rank SGLang
 * DP run, ~7x low on the 7-worker disaggregated rows).
 *
 * Every summed series — prefill/decode/prefix-hit rates, queue depth, host KV
 * usage and the prompt-token source breakdown — is now evaluated on one
 * canonical grid at the blob's native scrape cadence (`canonicalTickNs`), with
 * each component holding its last sample between its own scrapes
 * (`sumOntoGrid`). The grid has to be uniform, not the union of scrape
 * instants the way `averageAcrossEngines` does it: a mean is scale-free but a
 * sum is not, and `cumulativeUniqueInputTokens` turns these rates into token
 * totals with `sum += value`, which only stays correct at one point per
 * scrape bucket.
 *
 * v15: a metric SOURCE is one worker, not one engine inside it. The source
 * identity carried `dp_rank` (sglang) and `engine` (vllm), which name engines
 * *within* a worker, so the detail page's endpoint picker listed each worker
 * once per rank: a 6-prefill/1-decode run offered 35 "endpoints" for 7
 * workers, reading `Prefill - <id>` five times in a row. SGLang also emits an
 * unlabelled aggregate series alongside the per-rank ones, which became a
 * fifth entry for the same worker; vllm leaves `dp_rank` unset and duplicates
 * under `engine` instead, so the same bug wore a different label per
 * framework. Identity is now `(role, worker)` — see `seriesIdentityKey`'s
 * sibling reasoning in `server-metrics-adapters.ts`. Each worker's ranks
 * aggregate into its one source (throughput summed, KV averaged) and the
 * per-rank detail stays reachable as that source's own
 * `kvCacheUsageByEngine`.
