# InferenceX Dashboard

A [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) dashboard for visualizing ML inference benchmark data. DB-backed with Neon PostgreSQL, React Query for data fetching, D3.js for interactive charts.

**Stack**: Next.js 16 (App Router) · TypeScript · Tailwind CSS 4 · shadcn/ui · D3.js · Neon PostgreSQL · Vercel · Cypress

## Overview

LLM inference performance is a major concern of providing AI services, but accurate performance analysis remains elusive. Fast cadence of software development and model releases makes comparing performance between setups difficult. Existing performance benchmarks quickly become obsolete due to being static, and participants game the benchmarks with unrealistic, highly specific configurations. InferenceX tackles these issues by benchmarking popular models on major hardware platforms nightly with the latest software. For each model and hardware combination, InferenceX sweeps through different tensor parallel sizes and max concurrent requests, showing the throughput vs. latency graph for the full picture. In terms of software configurations, we ensure they are generally applicable across different serving scenarios, and we open source the repo to welcome community contributions. We hope InferenceX informs the community up-to-date and realistic LLM inference performance.

## Architecture

```
Neon PostgreSQL → API routes (/api/v1/*) → React Query hooks → Context providers → D3.js charts
```

The frontend fetches data from API routes backed by a Neon PostgreSQL read replica. All presentation logic lives in the frontend — API routes return raw DB data.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: 24.x
- **pnpm**: 10+

Install pnpm via Corepack (bundled with Node.js):

```bash
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate
```

## Getting Started

feel free to file an github issue if u need help setting up the dashboard

### 1. Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SemiAnalysisAI/InferenceX-app.git
cd InferenceX-app
pnpm install
```

### 2. Set Up Data Source

You can run the dashboard against either a live database or a static JSON dump. The JSON dump approach requires no database setup and is the easiest way to get started.

#### Option A: JSON Dump (no database required, local dev only)

Download the latest DB dump from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/SemiAnalysisAI/InferenceX-app/releases), unpack it, and point `DUMP_DIR` at the directory. The dump is xz-compressed and split into one or more `.tar.xz.part*` files; reassemble them by piping `cat` through `xz`. This only works with `pnpm dev`; production builds require a live database.

```bash
cp .env.example .env

# Download and unpack the latest dump (requires xz; `brew install xz` on macOS)
gh release download db-dump/2026-03-30 -p 'inferencex-dump-*.tar.xz.part*'
cat inferencex-dump-2026-03-30.tar.xz.part* | xz -d -T0 | tar -x

# Add to .env
echo 'DUMP_DIR=./inferencex-dump-2026-03-30' >> .env
```

Make sure `DATABASE_READONLY_URL` is not set (or is commented out) in your `.env`.

#### Option B: Live Database

Set `DATABASE_READONLY_URL` in your `.env` to a Neon PostgreSQL connection string. See [`.env.example`](.env.example) for details.

### 3. Run the Development Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser.

## Development Scripts

These are the main scripts you'll use during development. Admin scripts for database and cache management are listed separately below.
Some of these may require additional setup or environment variables.

### Admin Scripts

These are meant to be used for database and cache management and maintenance tasks, and should not be necessary during regular development.
However, using `pnpm admin:cache:invalidate` pointed at your local development server can be useful to test after making changes to the database or API routes.

| Script                              | Description                            |
