# Writing an InferenceX blog post

InferenceX blog posts are short, evidence-dense technical writeups that anchor a single headline number (e.g. "1.41x cheaper", "3.13x throughput", "7.7x peak throughput in 25 days") to (a) a Pareto chart from the live dashboard, (b) verified per-concurrency tables, and (c) the upstream PR that drove the change.

Posts live at `packages/app/content/blog/{slug}.mdx`. Images live at `packages/app/public/images/{slug}/`. The slug matches the MDX filename without `.mdx`.

## Step 0: Get the source of truth from the user

Before writing anything, ask the user for whichever of these they have:

1. **A chart image** from the InferenceX dashboard (this is the visual that will ship in the post)
2. **A CSV export** from the dashboard with the underlying rows (this is the authoritative numeric source)
3. **An "instant link" / preset URL** to the chart on `inferencex.semianalysis.com/inference?...` (this becomes both the `DashboardCTA` href and the live-chart link)
4. **A `/gpu-specs` radar image** for the SKUs in the comparison (the user clicks "Radar" on the dashboard's GPU specs page, toggles only the SKUs in the post, and screenshots). Used in the "On-Paper Specs" section as the second figure. If the post is a cross-vendor or cross-generation comparison, this is high-value and you should ask for it; if it's a same-SKU version-bump comparison (e.g. SGLang v0.5.5 → v0.5.6 on the same B200 pool), skip the radar.
5. **The upstream PR** that caused the change (SGLang / vLLM / TRT-LLM)
6. **The InferenceX recipe PR** that wired it into the benchmark loop
7. **Tweet / X post text** if there's a marketing framing they want the lede to echo

If the user gives you only the chart, ask for the CSV — the chart is for the figure, the CSV is for the tables. If they give only the CSV, that becomes source of truth even if a chart later appears.

## Step 1: Verify the numbers

When chart, CSV, and the InferenceX data dump disagree, use this priority:

1. **CSV the user pasted in chat** — they exported it from the dashboard, it matches whatever they saw
2. **Chart image the user shared** — read points off the curves visually; use it only when no CSV is available
3. **InferenceX data dump** (via the `inferencex-data` skill) — useful for sanity-check and for fields not in the CSV (TPOT, run IDs, image tags), but the dump can lag the chart by a week or more

Common gotchas:

- **Workload mismatch**: chart headers can mislead. Verify ISL/OSL from the data itself — 1k/1k and 8k/1k give wildly different `tok/s/GPU` and `$/M tokens` numbers. The blog title, lede, tables, and chart caption must all use the same ISL/OSL.
- **Latest run only**: filter to the highest `run_attempt` per `github_run_id`, then take the latest `date` per `(config_id, conc, isl, osl)`. See the `inferencex-data` skill for the exact filter.
- **Model spec verification**: never invent parameter counts. Always `WebSearch` the model's released specs (total params, active params, expert count, attention type) before writing the architecture paragraph. Cite sources. GLM-5 is _not_ GLM-4.5 — the numbers changed.
- **TCO values**: pull from the [SemiAnalysis AI Cloud TCO Model](https://semianalysis.com/ai-cloud-tco-model/). Current values (verify if older than a quarter):
  - H100 $1.30, H200 $1.41, B200 $1.95, B300 $2.34, GB200 $2.21, GB300 $2.652
  - MI300X $1.12, MI325X $1.28, MI355X $1.48
- **Cost per million tokens formula**: `$/M tok = TCO_$/GPU/hr * 1e6 / (3600 * tput_per_gpu)`. Equivalently in Python: `cost = tco / (3600 * tput / 1e6)`. Throughput is per-GPU, so GPU count cancels out for aggregated configs.
- **Bandwidth units — keep uni-di vs bi-di and GB/s vs Gbit/s consistent.** This is the single most common factor-of-two or factor-of-eight error in scale-up vs scale-out comparisons, and Cursor Bugbot will catch it. NVLink 5 per-GPU is **900 GB/s uni-directional** (1.8 TB/s bi-directional). ConnectX-7 InfiniBand / RoCEv2 Ethernet per-GPU is **400 Gbit/s = 50 GB/s uni-directional** (100 GB/s bi-di). The NVLink-to-IB/RoCE ratio is **18x in either direction**, not 36x. A previous post (gb200-nvl72-kimi-k2-5-vllm-wide-ep-3x-vs-b200.mdx) shipped with 36x because it compared NVLink bi-di against IB uni-di — flag this if you encounter it in older posts. House rule for new posts: always state "uni-directional" or "uni-di" explicitly, and convert Gbit/s to GB/s in the same sentence so readers can audit the math.

### Iso-interactivity interpolation — match the chart, not your shell script

The dashboard chart uses a **monotone cubic Hermite spline (Steffen 1990, identical to `d3.curveMonotoneX`)** on the **upper-left Pareto frontier** of (interactivity, throughput). Linear interpolation in a one-off Python REPL will not match what readers see in the chart and will get flagged in review.

**Always use the bundled helper:**

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/write-inferencex-blog/iso_interactivity.py
# stdin:  {"points": [{"interactivity": .., "throughput": .., "cost_per_M": ..}, ...],
#          "target_iv": 18.0, "metric_key": "cost_per_M"}
# stdout: {"value": 0.22}  // or null when target is outside frontier range
```

Or import it as a module from a small wrapper script if you're computing many rows at once.

Rules to follow because the helper enforces them — but you need to interpret them correctly when writing the table:

- **No extrapolation.** When the target interactivity falls outside the frontier's `[min x, max x]`, the helper returns `null`. Render those cells as `_unreachable_` (and the ratio column as `_∞_` if comparing two dates/configs). Do not invent a value. This is the whole reason the chart code returns `null` — the recipe physically can't reach that operating point.
- **Frontier is always built on (interactivity, throughput).** Even when interpolating cost or TPOT or energy, the frontier itself is the upper-left envelope on throughput-vs-interactivity. Other metrics are derived values at frontier knots. This matches `interpolateForGPU` in the chart code: one frontier, many metrics interpolated against it.
- **Multiple recipes (TP=4, TP=8, etc.) for the same hardware go into one points list together.** The Pareto operation collapses them into a single combined frontier, exactly as the chart does when both recipes are toggled on.
- **The Y values are clamped to the frontier's min/max** to prevent cubic-spline overshoot above/below the data. Don't be surprised when the interpolated value sits at a knot value rather than between two knots — that's the spline saying "any value here would overshoot the data."

The canonical source of truth is `packages/app/src/components/calculator/interpolation.ts` (functions `paretoFrontUpperLeft`, `monotoneSlopes`, `hermiteInterpolate`) and `packages/app/src/components/inference/hooks/useInterpolatedTrendData.ts` (function `interpolateMetricAtInteractivity`). If you ever need to change the algorithm, change all three files — the TS pair plus the Python helper — in the same PR. The repository's `AGENTS.md` codifies this as a hard rule.

#### How the Pareto frontier behaves between the knots

The frontier is the set of measured `(interactivity, throughput)` points that are **not dominated** by any other point — a point is dominated if some other point in the dataset has both higher interactivity AND higher throughput. Geometrically, you sort the points by interactivity ascending, walk from left to right, and keep popping the previous point off the stack as long as the new point's throughput is greater or equal. What survives is the upper-left envelope: a staircase of points where as interactivity decreases (moving left), throughput increases (moving up), monotonically. Everything "inside" that envelope was a worse operating point on both axes simultaneously and is discarded — it could never be chosen in production.

The chart then draws a smooth curve **through these surviving knots only**. The curve is a piecewise cubic — between each adjacent pair of frontier knots `(xᵢ, yᵢ)` and `(xᵢ₊₁, yᵢ₊₁)`, the chart draws a Hermite cubic specified by the two endpoint values and two tangent slopes `mᵢ`, `mᵢ₊₁` at each end. The tangents are computed by Steffen's 1990 monotone construction (identical to d3's `curveMonotoneX`), which has one critical property: the cubic between two knots **never overshoots** the throughput values at those knots. If two adjacent knots have throughputs 3,000 and 4,000, the curve between them stays inside `[3,000, 4,000]` — no spurious bumps above 4,000 or dips below 3,000, even if the slopes from neighboring segments would push it that way. This is why simple cubic splines aren't used: they wiggle, and the chart would imply throughput values that the silicon never actually produced.

So when you interpolate at `target_iv = 18`, the helper does this: (1) finds the bracket `[xᵢ, xᵢ₊₁]` containing 18, (2) evaluates the Hermite cubic `h₀₀·yᵢ + h₁₀·hh·mᵢ + h₀₁·yᵢ₊₁ + h₁₁·hh·mᵢ₊₁` at `t = (18 − xᵢ) / (xᵢ₊₁ − xᵢ)`, and (3) clamps the result to the metric's `[min, max]` across the entire frontier as a final safety net against any residual overshoot. If 18 is to the left of the smallest frontier x or to the right of the largest, the helper returns `null` — there is no extrapolation, because the chart code itself draws no curve outside the data range.

What this means for the blog tables: the interpolated values you publish track the **shape of the rendered curve** between knots, not a straight line. At iso-interactivity points that happen to sit very close to a knot, the published number will land very close to that knot's measured value. In the middle of a wide segment, the spline can sit noticeably above or below the linear-interpolation guess — sometimes by 10% or more on steep parts of the curve. That difference is what readers see in the chart, so it's what the table must show.

## Step 2: Slug and image directory

Slug naming follows the pattern of existing posts (see `packages/app/content/blog/*.mdx`):

- `{hardware}-{model}-{framework}-{key-claim-or-number}` — e.g. `mi355x-kimi-k2-5-vllm-aiter-7x-speedup`
- `{framework}-{version}-{hardware}-{model}-{key-claim}` — e.g. `sglang-0-5-6-b200-deepseek-r1-fp4-up-to-1-8x`
- Include a comparator when relevant — e.g. `gb200-nvl72-kimi-k2-5-vllm-wide-ep-3x-vs-b200`

Then `mkdir -p packages/app/public/images/{slug}/` and ask the user to drop `benchmark-light.png` and `benchmark-dark.png` there (or do it yourself if they shared the files).

**Image filename convention.** Every image needs both `-light.png` and `-dark.png` variants (drop the same file in for both if the user only has one — placeholder is fine). Filenames should describe what's in the image, not its position in the post:

- `benchmark-{light,dark}.png` — the headline Pareto / throughput / cost chart
- `{architecture}-rack-{light,dark}.png` — rack diagrams (e.g. `gb200-nvl72-rack-light.png`)
- `{topology}-topology-{light,dark}.png` — NVLink / scale-up topology diagrams
- `{kernel-or-feature}-timeline-{light,dark}.png` — profiler timelines

Never use numeric names (`figure1`, `figure2`) — they break when figures get reordered and they tell the next reader nothing.

## Step 3: Frontmatter

```yaml
---
title: 'Punchy headline with the number — under ~75 chars'
subtitle: 'One-sentence explanation of the mechanism, the workload, and the comparator — ~150-200 chars'
date: '2026-MM-DD'
publishDate: '2026-MM-DD'
tags:
  - benchmark
  - gpu
  - inference
  - {model-slug, e.g. glm5, kimi, deepseek}
  - {vendor, e.g. amd, nvidia}
  - {hardware-slug, e.g. mi355x, b200, gb200}
  - {framework, e.g. sglang, vllm, trtllm}
  - {os/runtime, e.g. rocm} (optional)
---
```

Use `date` == `publishDate` == ISO YYYY-MM-DD. The same date appears in the lede ("measured on InferenceX on 2026-MM-DD").

**Title and subtitle prefer model name + headline ratio + the interactivity point at which it peaks.** Not a laundry list of framework + precision + workload + parallelism — those belong in the body. Compare:

- Good: `'GB200 NVL72 vs B200 on DeepSeek R1 670B: Up to 4.4x Throughput per GPU at 125 tok/s/user'`
- Avoid: `'GB200 NVL72 vs B200 on DeepSeek R1 FP4 Dynamo TRT Disagg: Up to 4.4x Throughput per GPU in the Middle of the Curve'`

Title gives the SKUs, the model, the headline number, and the interactivity anchor. Subtitle gives the one-sentence mechanism (e.g. "NVLink scale-up vs RoCEv2 EP cap") plus the workload (precision + ISL/OSL). Frameworks, MTP, and recipe details get a line in the body, not the title.

## Step 4: Body structure

Sections, in order:

### Lede (1-2 short paragraphs, no heading)

Lead with the headline number and the workload, both in the first sentence:

> "14 weeks after GLM-5's release, AMD MI355X SGLang FP8 undercuts NVIDIA B200 SGLang FP8 on cost per million tokens across the entire single-node Pareto frontier on the 8k/1k workload. The peak gap is **1.41x at 18 tok/s/user with MTP** ($0.30/M on B200 vs $0.22/M on MI355X — a 40% reduction)..."

Bold the peak ratio in the lede. Second paragraph: name the upstream PRs that made it happen, then end with a short framing line ("Speed is the moat.", "Software is the moat.", etc.) if it fits — don't force it.

### `<DashboardCTA>` immediately after the lede

```mdx
<DashboardCTA href="{the instant link / preset URL}">
  Click to see the full InferenceX dashboard →
</DashboardCTA>
```

Use the preset URL the user provided so clicking lands on the exact comparison view, not the bare dashboard. Format: `https://inferencex.semianalysis.com/inference?g_model=...&i_prec=...&g_rundate=...&g_runid=...&i_active={hw1}_{fw1}%2C{hw2}_{fw2}&i_metric=y_costh&i_linelabel=1`.

### `<Figure>` hero image immediately after the top DashboardCTA

The chart image is the **hero** of the post — it goes right after the top `<DashboardCTA>`, **before** the model / architecture paragraph, so readers see the curves before they read the prose. Do not bury the figure halfway down without one at the top.

```mdx
<Figure
  srcLight="/images/{slug}/benchmark-light.png"
  srcDark="/images/{slug}/benchmark-dark.png"
  alt="Plain-English description of the chart including model, precision, ISL/OSL, both compared SKUs/frameworks, and any toggles (MTP/non-MTP)"
  caption="Short caption. Note any non-obvious labeling convention used on the chart (e.g. 'Labels denote GPU count per config.')."
/>
```

Use the **same `<Figure>` block twice**: once here as the hero (so the chart anchors the post visually before the reader hits the technical prose), and once more directly below the iso-interactivity table further down (so the chart is right next to the data that derives from it, instead of forcing readers to scroll back up). Both `<Figure>` blocks are identical — same `srcLight`/`srcDark`/`alt`/`caption`. The repetition is intentional and matches how readers consume the post.

**Architectural diagrams (rack layouts, topology diagrams) go between the architectural prose and the DashboardCTA, not buried lower down.** If the post discusses a rack-scale system, scale-up domain, NVLink island, prefill/decode pool topology, or anything where a picture is worth a paragraph, drop it in immediately after the prose that motivates it. Example from `gb200-nvl72-vs-b200-disagg-deepseek-r1-fp4-dynamo-trt.mdx`: the lede mentions "all 72 GPUs over NVLink 5" → next paragraph explains the 8-GPU NVLink island vs 72-GPU rack → next thing the reader sees is the GB200 NVL72 rack diagram showing the 18 compute trays / 9 NVSwitch5 trays. The visual grounds the technical claim before the data tables appear. Use the same `<Figure>` block format as the hero chart, with `srcLight`/`srcDark` even if dark is a placeholder copy of light.

### Model / architecture paragraph

One paragraph naming the model, vendor, release date (use it to compute "N weeks after release" if it sharpens the cadence framing), total/active parameters, expert count + top-K routing, attention mechanism (MLA, NSA/DSA, GQA, etc.), and context window. **Always WebSearch to verify these numbers** — don't carry over from a prior generation. Cite a source URL inline if the number is non-obvious.

Then a follow-on paragraph that ties the architecture details to _why this PR matters on this hardware_ — e.g. "MI355X's FP8 KV path landed in mid-April, and the resulting decode throughput moved enough that MI355X's lower per-GPU TCO ($1.48/GPU/hr vs B200 at $1.95/GPU/hr per the [SemiAnalysis AI Cloud TCO Model](...)) now compounds into a real cost-per-token advantage instead of being swamped by software gaps."

### `## On-Paper Specs` (cross-SKU comparisons only)

Skip this section for same-SKU version-bump posts (e.g. SGLang v0.5.5 → v0.5.6 on the same B200 pool) — the hardware hasn't changed and the reader doesn't need it. For any cross-vendor, cross-generation, or scale-up-domain comparison (B200 vs H200, MI355X vs B200, GB200 NVL72 vs B200 HGX, etc.), include this section _between the model/architecture paragraph and `## What Shipped to Make This Happen`_. It anchors the reader on raw silicon ratios before they hit the recipe details and the measured perf/$ numbers, so the body's "the measured lift is HBM-bound, here's why" framing has somewhere to land.

Structure (~3 elements, in order):

1. **One short intro paragraph** — name the two SKUs and their generation, then explain that the radar normalizes each axis to the cross-vendor maximum in [`/gpu-specs`](/gpu-specs), so the visible polygons compress against axes where a different SKU (typically GB200/GB300 NVL72 for scale-up-domain axes, GB300 NVL72 for FP4) sets the ceiling.
2. **`<Figure>` for the radar.** Save the user's radar screenshot to `packages/app/public/images/{slug}/specs-radar-light.png` (and `-dark.png` — copy the same file in if they only have one). The caption should call out (a) which SKU sets the ceiling on the most-visually-compressed axes and the absolute max value (e.g. "FP4 max is GB300 NVL72 at 15 PFLOP/s/GPU, so B200's 9 PFLOP/s reads ~60%"), (b) that the older-gen SKU reads 0% on the FP4 axis when it has no FP4 tensor cores.
3. **Absolute specs table.** Pull values directly from `packages/app/src/lib/gpu-specs.ts` — never paraphrase from memory or a vendor datasheet, because the spec file is the source of truth the dashboard renders. Include both per-GPU and scale-up-domain rows so the reader can audit the implications paragraph.

Standard row set (10 rows, in this order; drop rows that are identical and uninteresting for a same-vendor same-generation comparison):

| Spec                               | SKU A                                | SKU B             | B / A          |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------- | -------------- |
| HBM capacity                       | `memory` value                       | `memory` value    | ratio          |
| HBM bandwidth                      | `memoryBandwidth`                    | `memoryBandwidth` | ratio          |
| Dense FP4 (TFLOP/s)                | `fp4` (or `—` if null)               | `fp4`             | ratio (or `—`) |
| Dense FP8 (TFLOP/s)                | `fp8`                                | `fp8`             | ratio          |
| Dense BF16 (TFLOP/s)               | `bf16`                               | `bf16`            | ratio          |
| Scale-up BW per GPU (uni-di)       | `scaleUpBandwidth` (`scaleUpTech`)   | same              | ratio          |
| Scale-up world size                | `scaleUpWorldSize`                   | same              | ratio          |
| Scale-up domain HBM capacity       | `memory × scaleUpWorldSize`          | same              | ratio          |
| Scale-up domain HBM BW (aggregate) | `memoryBandwidth × scaleUpWorldSize` | same              | ratio          |
| TCO (SemiAnalysis AI Cloud Model)  | `$X/GPU/hr`                          | `$Y/GPU/hr`       | ratio          |

Render the FP4 row as `—` (em-dash, not "N/A") in both the value and ratio columns when the older SKU lacks FP4 tensor cores — this matches the chart's "0% on FP4" rendering and avoids the misleading appearance of an infinite ratio.

4. **One "implications" paragraph** that turns the raw ratios into a perf/$ bracket. Standard form: "with the same precision and the same recipe, SKU B's perf/$ ceiling vs SKU A is bounded by `(FP8 ratio) / (TCO ratio)` on a fully compute-bound workload and by `(HBM BW ratio) / (TCO ratio)` on a fully memory-bandwidth-bound workload (with NVLink BW giving a middle bound at `(NVLink BW ratio) / (TCO ratio)`)." Then state which bracket the post's measured lift lands in and why — this is the bridge to the next section. If the precision step is the headline (FP8 → FP4 on the new SKU), close with "X is the lever that breaks the GEMM ceiling: A has zero FP4 tensor cores, B has Y PFLOP/s, and the resulting precision step compounds N×–M× on top."

### `## What Shipped to Make This Happen`

The technical breakdown. For each PR:

- Link with `[{org}/{repo} PR #{n}]({url})`
- Name the author (link their GitHub handle)
- Merge date
- One sentence on what the kernel/feature does
- A bullet or two on the per-hardware fusion strategy (this is what makes the post interesting to engineers — fusion shapes differ per generation, e.g. MI355 vs MI300)
- Activation flags (e.g. `--kv-cache-dtype fp8_e4m3 --nsa-prefill-backend tilelang`)
- Quantitative claims from the PR description (throughput delta, accuracy delta)

If there are multiple PRs (upstream framework + InferenceX recipe), list them in causal order — upstream first, recipe second.

### `## The Numbers`

Intro paragraph: state the workload (ISL/OSL), the disaggregation status (single-node aggregated, or disagg + N prefill / M decode), the measurement date, the cost formula, and the TCO values used.

Then one labeled table per (hardware, framework, spec_method, TP, GPU-count) combination, in this order:

1. Reference recipe being compared _against_ (typically NVIDIA)
2. The headline-winning recipe (typically the AMD config that anchors the cost win)
3. Any additional recipes that fill out the Pareto (e.g. the same vendor's TP=8 arm if TP=4 was the anchor)
4. Non-MTP variants of the above if the post covers both

Table columns: `Conc | tok/s/GPU | tok/s/user | TPOT (ms) | $/M tokens`. Right-align numerics by using markdown column alignment. Show all measured concurrencies, not just the headline one. Numbers come straight from the CSV; round throughput to 1 decimal, TPOT to 2 decimals, cost to 2 decimals.

### `## Iso-Interactivity Cost Comparison`

This is where the headline ratio gets made explicit. One short intro sentence ("Throughput per GPU at matched interactivity, interpolated along each SKU's Pareto frontier."), one sentence on the `_unreachable_` convention if it appears in the table, then the table(s) — MTP and non-MTP if both are in scope, otherwise one.

>
> Before saving the MDX, grep your draft for `monotone|Hermite|Steffen|spline|curveMonotoneX` and delete any hit. If you find yourself wanting to explain _why_ the table values match the chart values, the answer goes in the iso-interactivity table's `_unreachable_` legend or in a footnote — never by naming the algorithm.

Columns: `Interactivity (tok/s/user) | {NVIDIA} $/M tok | {AMD} $/M tok | {NVIDIA} / {AMD}`. Bold the peak-gap row. Show 5-8 rows covering the interesting band — include at least one row where the gap narrows or reverses, so the post stays honest.

**Row-pruning heuristic for `_unreachable_` cells.** The first row of the table must have two real numbers — never start with an `_unreachable_` row, even if that interactivity is technically in your range. Start where both SKUs are measurable so the reader anchors on a real comparison. `_unreachable_` rows are great in the middle or at the end of the table where they tell a regime-extension story ("B200 wins at 300 tok/s/user where GB200 NVL72 has no recipe at all"), but a table that opens with `_∞_` reads like the data is missing rather than that one curve genuinely doesn't reach there.

Follow with one paragraph explaining _why_ the gap peaks where it does (e.g. "the MI355X 4-GPU TP=4 recipe plateaus at $0.22 while B200 is still climbing"), and one sentence noting where the gap inverts (e.g. "Above 90 tok/s/user the comparison flips marginally back to B200 because there is no MI355X recipe matching B200's TP=8 conc 4 at 100+ tok/s/user."). **Don't paper over the inversion** — call it out.

### Second `<Figure>` + `[Live chart]` link after the iso-interactivity tables

Place the **same** `<Figure>` block from Step 4 here again, immediately followed by a `[Live chart]({preset URL})` link. The repeat is intentional: readers who scrolled past the hero figure at the top need to see the chart next to the data table that derives from it, not scroll back up.

```mdx

Same `srcLight`/`srcDark`/`alt`/`caption` as the top placement — copy-paste, do not vary.

### `## What's Next for {SKU/framework} on {Model}` (or similar)

The honest scope-limiting section. Bullet list of what this result _doesn't_ cover yet, each with concrete context:

- **FP4 composability** — link the InferenceX FP4 recipe PR if it exists, note its current state
- **Disaggregation / wide expert parallelism** — link a relevant prior InferenceX post or recipe
- Anything else the headline number leaves on the table

End with one sentence affirming where the result _is_ definitive ("For chat-style serving in the 30-60 tok/s/user band, MI355X SGLang FP8 with MTP is the cheaper per-million-tokens choice today on GLM-5.").

### `## Acknowledgments`

Name the engineers who shipped the upstream + InferenceX changes. Link X handles and GitHub handles. Close with a one-sentence framing if it fits.

### Trailing `<DashboardCTA>`

Repeat the same `DashboardCTA` block. This is the reader's exit ramp into the dashboard.

### `<JsonLd>` FAQ

Five questions covering: (1) the headline cost / throughput ratio, (2) what the upstream PR does, (3) why the gap peaks where it does, (4) does the result hold for the non-MTP / FP4 / alternate variant, (5) what's not yet covered. Numbers in the answers must match the body verbatim. Plain-text only inside the JSON string — no markdown, no emoji, no special quotes.

## Step 5: Draft → browser editor → human review → commit → push → PR

**Do not commit, push, or open a PR on your own.** When the MDX file is written, stop and hand it to the user for review. Wait for explicit approval (e.g. "ship", "looks good, push", "create the PR") before touching git. Reasons:

- Numbers in the post are claims the user will be publicly attached to. They need a chance to spot-check ratios, names, and PR descriptions before the PR notification fires.
- The frontmatter date, slug, image filenames, and dashboard URL are all hard to change once a PR is open and a Vercel preview is generated.
- A blog post is not a code change — it benefits from an editorial pass, not a CI pass.

**Always launch the bundled browser editor for the review pass.** Do not ask the user to read MDX in their IDE — the auto-save split-pane editor in this skill gives them a rendered preview, an editable source pane, and writes changes back to disk automatically. Launch it as soon as the draft is written:

```bash
node .claude/skills/write-inferencex-blog/editor.mjs \
  packages/app/content/blog/{slug}.mdx &
sleep 1 && open http://127.0.0.1:4747/
```

The editor runs as a background Node process on `127.0.0.1:4747`, reads from and writes to the absolute path of the file you pass on argv (no hard-coded paths — `~/`-normalized display only), and auto-saves ~800 ms after the last keystroke. `Cmd+S` forces an immediate save. Tell the user the URL, that edits are auto-saved, and that `git status` will reflect their changes when they're done.

While the user reviews in the browser, you can:

- Run `pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck` against the working tree to catch any MDX errors that would block the pre-commit hook later.
- Save the chart image into `packages/app/public/images/{slug}/benchmark-light.png` (and `benchmark-dark.png` if the user provided both) so the `<Figure>` placeholder in the preview shows a real path.

**Concurrent-edit collision warning.** The browser editor auto-saves the user's textarea ~800 ms after their last keystroke. If you re-edit a paragraph the user has open in CodeMirror, your `Edit` call writes to disk first, then the editor's debounced save overwrites your change with the user's stale buffer the next time they type or the timer fires. Failure mode: user asks you to expand a paragraph, you expand it on disk, user types one more character in the browser, the one-liner comes back. When you need to edit a section the user is actively working on, **tell the user explicitly to either close the browser tab or hit the "↻ Reload from disk" button before resuming editing**. Don't rely on them noticing the collision — it looks like nothing happened from their side.

When the user gives the green light, **stop the editor process first** so its auto-save can't clobber the final-pass content during the commit window:

```bash
lsof -ti tcp:4747 | xargs -r kill   # or TaskStop on the bash background id
```

Then run the git sequence in one shot:

```bash
git checkout -b blog/{slug} origin/master
git add packages/app/content/blog/{slug}.mdx packages/app/public/images/{slug}/
git commit -m "feat(blog): {title-ish}"
git push -u origin blog/{slug}
gh pr create --title "feat(blog): ..." --body "..."
```

The pre-commit hook runs `oxlint`, `oxfmt`, and `tsc --noEmit`. All three must pass. If lint/format fails, run `pnpm lint:fix && pnpm fmt:fix` and re-commit (don't `--no-verify`).

After the PR opens, expect Cursor Bugbot to flag correctness issues in the prose (numeric overstatement, claims contradicted by tables, wrong attribution). Treat its findings as real review comments — fix them in a follow-up commit, then resolve the threads. Branch protection on master requires resolved review threads before auto-merge fires.

## House style

- Numbers carry the post. Adjectives don't. Avoid "incredible", "massive", "huge", "groundbreaking" — say the number. This includes vague positional adjectives: write "at 125 tok/s/user" or "in the 75–175 tok/s/user band", not "in the middle of the curve" or "at the cheap end". Section headings, table captions, and the lede should all use concrete interactivity ranges.
- Active voice, present tense for measured results, past tense for shipped PRs.
- "tok/s/user" not "TPS/user" or "tokens per second per user".
- "$/M tokens" or "per million tokens" — pick one and stay consistent.
- "MTP" on first mention can be spelled out as "Multi-Token Prediction speculative decoding"; after that just "MTP".
- For NVIDIA SKUs use the marketing capitalization: B200, GB200 NVL72, H100, H200, B300, GB300, GB300 NVL72.
- For AMD SKUs: MI300X, MI325X, MI355X.
- For frameworks: SGLang, vLLM, TRT-LLM (or TensorRT-LLM in formal contexts), Dynamo TRT-LLM, Dynamo vLLM, Dynamo SGLang. AMD's disagg fork is `mori-sglang`.
- Use em-dashes `—` not double-hyphens.
- Link the upstream PRs and InferenceX recipe PRs every time. Reader wants the receipts.
- **Cross-links go where the prose motivates them, not in the lede.** Link `/gpu-specs`, prior InferenceX posts, kernel-recipe docs, and SemiAnalysis models _next to the sentence that earns the click_ — when the post discusses NVLink fanout, the `/gpu-specs` link goes in that paragraph, not in the headline number sentence. The lede is for the headline ratio and the workload; navigation belongs in the body. Link each cross-target once at the first place it's contextually motivated, not at every mention of the SKU/model/topic.
- **Write tight first, expand only on request.** Default to 1-3 short paragraphs per explanation; trust the reader to ask for more detail in review. Long preemptive expansions get trimmed back by the reviewer (and overwritten by the browser editor's auto-save while you wait). The compute-comm-overlap framing template in the "Reusable technical framings" section is the upper bound — don't go longer than that even for the most central technical argument.
- **Don't restate the table contents in prose.** If the reader can see "4,130 vs 941 tok/s/GPU = 4.39x at 125 tok/s/user" in the iso-interactivity row, don't also write it in the closing paragraph after the table. Use the prose around tables to explain the WHY, not to summarize the WHAT. A closing paragraph that just restates the headline number gets removed in editorial review.
- Don't apologize for non-coverage in the lede — save it for "What's Next".
- **Don't use the "X, not Y" antithesis construction for emphasis.** AI writing tics this hard — phrases like "the gap is silicon × precision, **not** framework", "every gain came from the kernels, **not** the silicon", "it's a software story, **not** a hardware one", "this is a real lever, **not** a paper one". Reads as performatively contrarian flexing and is one of the loudest AI-prose tells. State the thing on its own; if the "Y" the reader might have guessed is actually plausible-but-wrong, address it on its merits in a separate sentence (or skip it — usually the table that follows kills the wrong guess on its own).
  - Avoid: "The gap is silicon × precision, not framework."
  - Use instead: "The gap is silicon × precision." (or, if you really need to neutralize the framework guess: "Both run the same vLLM build; the spread comes from the silicon and the precision.")
  - Avoid: "This is a real lever, not a paper one."
  - Use instead: just delete the sentence — the data already shows it is real.
  - Avoid: "The lift came from the kernels, not the silicon."
  - Use instead: "Same hardware on both dates — every gain came from the kernels."

## Reusable technical framings

These are explainer templates that come up repeatedly. Adapt the prose to the specific workload, but the underlying mechanic and the structure of the argument carry over.

### "Why rack-scale NVL72 wins in the medium-batch / medium-interactivity band on a sparse MoE"

Use for any GB200 NVL72 / GB300 NVL72 vs HGX node comparison on a many-routed-expert MoE (DeepSeek R1, Kimi K2.5, GLM-5, etc.). The mechanic:

1. **Three regimes on the throughput-vs-interactivity curve, mapped correctly to batch size.** Read the x-axis as interactivity, but always think of it as "small batch on the right, huge batch on the left" — that's what determines the bottleneck.
   - **Right end of chart (high interactivity, small batch) = weight-bandwidth-bound.** Each decode step loads the full expert weights from HBM but only computes on a handful of tokens. Per-token cost is dominated by HBM reads of weights you barely use before reloading the next set. This is the regime where wider EP is most attractive in theory (smaller per-rank expert footprint → less weight loading per step), but it doesn't help in practice because the per-step latency floor is already pinned by attention and a single MoE dispatch, and adding ranks just adds collective overhead.
   - **Middle of chart (medium interactivity, medium batch with wide EP enabled) = network-bound on the EP dispatch and combine collectives.** This is where the rack-scale fabric advantage lives. The compute-comm overlap mechanic in step 3 below is the entire story here.
   - **Left end of chart (low interactivity, huge batch) = compute-bound + KV-cache-bandwidth-bound + (for disagg) cross-rack KV transfer.** Weights are amortized across thousands of tokens per step, so weight bandwidth stops mattering. The bottleneck shifts to tensor-core saturation on the MoE GEMMs and HBM reads of the per-user KV cache (which is enormous at high batch). For disaggregated serving, the prefill→decode KV transfer also becomes meaningful here. Both NVL72 and HGX-disagg-multinode collapse onto narrow EP=4 + DP attention in this regime — wide EP buys you nothing because weight amortization is already happening for free at high batch.
   - **Watch out: do not flip these regimes.** The most common mistake (and one I've made on prior drafts) is to label the left end as weight-bandwidth-bound. It is the _opposite_ — large batch is where weight bandwidth stops being the bottleneck because each loaded weight serves many tokens. The right end is where weight bandwidth bites.
2. **What dispatch and combine actually do.** Each MoE layer fires two all-to-all collectives per token: a **dispatch** routing each token to the K of N experts it was assigned to (on remote ranks under wide EP), and a **combine** gathering the expert outputs back to each token's home rank. Across L MoE layers that is roughly 2×L collectives per token. Spell out the per-token collective count — readers anchor on it.
3. **Compute-comm overlap on fast networks.** When the cross-rank network is fast enough, the runtime issues the dispatch, starts the expert GEMM on tokens that have already arrived, finishes the GEMM in roughly the time it takes for the remaining bytes to land, then issues the combine. The collective latency disappears from the critical path because the GPU was busy throughout. NVLink 5 at 900 GB/s per GPU uni-di is in this regime for EP=16 or EP=32 medium-batch decode.
4. **Exposed comms on slow networks.** Drop the network bandwidth by 18x (ConnectX-7 RoCEv2 Ethernet or IB at 50 GB/s uni-di) and the same collective takes 18x longer per byte moved, no longer fits inside the GEMM budget, and exposes itself as raw communication time. Profilers show this as visible gaps in the GPU timeline. Widening EP makes it strictly worse because every additional rank adds more exposed-comm time than it saves in HBM bandwidth — so single-node multinode HGX recipes have to drop back to single-node EP=8 where the collective stays on intra-node NVLink, at the cost of a much smaller wide-EP throughput win.
5. **The cross-regime structure of the gap.** Peak throughput (low interactivity, huge batch) gap is small because both SKUs converge on narrow EP=4 + DP attention — at this batch size weight loading is already amortized across thousands of tokens, so wide EP buys nothing and the only differences left are tensor-core throughput, KV-cache bandwidth, and (for disagg) the cross-rack prefill→decode KV transfer. NVL72 wins this band modestly (typically 1.1x–1.2x) on the KV transfer alone. Middle-of-the-band gap (medium interactivity, medium batch) is large because that's where compute-comm overlap on the EP collectives is the deciding factor — see step 3. High-interactivity (small batch) gap inverts because small batches fit on one NVLink island, the cross-rack hop becomes pure overhead, and the per-step latency floor is already pinned by attention + a single MoE dispatch regardless of fabric. Always call out the inversion explicitly — the curves crossing is the most honest part of the post.

Existing posts using this framing as a template: `gb200-nvl72-kimi-k2-5-vllm-wide-ep-3x-vs-b200.mdx`, `gb200-nvl72-vs-b200-disagg-deepseek-r1-fp4-dynamo-trt.mdx`.

## Reference posts — REQUIRED reading before drafting

**Before writing a single word, read every existing post in `packages/app/content/blog/*.mdx`.** This is not optional and not "open when in doubt." The InferenceX voice — the cadence framing, the "speed is the moat" close, the way technical PRs get cited with author handles, the table → iso-interactivity → "What's Next" arc, the willingness to call out where the headline gap inverts — is set by the existing posts. A draft that hasn't absorbed them will read like a generic vendor comparison and get flagged. Use `ls packages/app/content/blog/` to enumerate, then `Read` each MDX in full.

**Two of the existing posts are foundational and must be read heavily** — multiple passes, paying attention to structure and tone, not just skimming for facts:

- **`packages/app/content/blog/inferencex-v2-nvidia-blackwell-vs-amd-vs-hopper.mdx`** — the launch piece for InferenceXv2 (formerly InferenceMAX). Sets the editorial voice for the whole series: the "composability" framing for AMD's gaps, the rack-scale vs single-node distinction, the way TCO and per-GPU economics get woven into the technical discussion, the Acknowledgments style that names individual NVIDIA and AMD engineers by first name, and the "key observations and results" overview that anchors everything in the actual benchmark dataset. Every later post implicitly assumes the reader has seen this one. Match its tone.
- **`packages/app/content/blog/inferencemax-open-source-inference-benchmarking.mdx`** — the origin story for the open-source benchmark. Establishes why InferenceX exists (continuous benchmarking vs point-in-time studies), what "the loop" is (upstream PR → InferenceX recipe → next benchmark run within days), and why "speed is the moat" is the recurring close — software cadence on the same hardware moves the curve more than silicon upgrades on any given quarter. Borrow its framing about why benchmark cadence matters.

After the two foundational posts, the closest structural templates per post type:

- `packages/app/content/blog/mi355x-glm5-fp8-sglang-40-cheaper-than-b200.mdx` — AMD wins on TCO, single-node, MTP + non-MTP, with iso-interactivity tables and honest gap-inversion call-out. Closest template for AMD-vs-NVIDIA single-node cost posts.
- `packages/app/content/blog/mi355x-kimi-k2-5-vllm-aiter-7x-speedup.mdx` — Single-PR speedup story, 25-day cadence, iso-throughput interpolation. Closest template for "one PR moved the curve" posts.
- `packages/app/content/blog/sglang-0-5-6-b200-deepseek-r1-fp4-up-to-1-8x.mdx` — Same-hardware version-bump story. Closest template for "framework release X is N% faster than X-1" posts.
- `packages/app/content/blog/gb200-nvl72-kimi-k2-5-vllm-wide-ep-3x-vs-b200.mdx` — Rack-scale wide EP story. Closest template for "scale-up fabric unlocks a new operating regime" posts.
- `packages/app/content/blog/mi355x-qwen3-5-sglang-v0-5-12-up-to-17x.mdx` — Three-date version-bump time series with the spline iso-interactivity comparison and the `_unreachable_` cell convention for out-of-frontier interactivities.

## When the user has only a chart image

If no CSV is available and you must read values off the chart:

1. Identify the metric (y-axis label) and units. Cost charts on the dashboard are typically "Cost per Million Total Tokens (Owning – Hyperscaler)" — these are owning-cost values, not the difference.
2. Identify the curves by legend color. AMD lines are typically pink/red, NVIDIA lines green. MTP variants are darker shades of the base curve color.
3. Identify the labels on each point — typically the GPU count for the config, _not_ the concurrency. Concurrency increases as you move down-and-left on the cost-vs-interactivity curve (more batch → lower latency-per-token but lower interactivity).
4. Read 5-7 points off each curve, recording (interactivity, cost).
5. Linearly interpolate at the iso-interactivity comparison points.
6. **Flag in the post that the per-conc tables would need a fresh dump to match the chart exactly** — readers should know which view is the canonical source.

Better: push back on the user and ask for the CSV before writing. It saves time downstream when a number needs to change.
