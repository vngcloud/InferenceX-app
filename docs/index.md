# InferenceX Docs

Design rationale and non-obvious conventions. See [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) for the quick-start project guide.

## Docs

- [Architecture](./architecture.md) — Why client-first, hash routing, URL state, provider nesting, server-side caching (unstable_cache + blob), in-memory client cache, color system, analytics enforcement
- [D3 Charts](./d3-charts.md) — Why 4 effects, in-place mutation, refs for zoom, rAF throttling, HTML tooltips, Pareto directions, gradient labels
- [Data Pipeline](./data-pipeline.md) — DB schema reasoning, ETL design, transform pipeline, spline method choice, normalizer resolution order (model/GPU/framework)
- [Pitfalls](./pitfalls.md) — Failure modes: token type consistency, schema evolution, empty objects, zoom loss, stale closures, disaggregated metrics, negative splines, date stamping, ref stability, cost inheritance
- [GPU Specs](./gpu-specs.md) — Unit conventions, topology invariants, SVG layout rationale, hardware gotchas
- [TCO Calculator](./tco-calculator.md) — Why interpolation, composite keys, cost matrix, token type bugs, badge logic, state design
- [Adding Entities](./adding-entities.md) — Step-by-step checklists for adding new models, GPUs, precisions, sequences, frameworks (ingest + constants + frontend)
- [Testing](./testing.md) — Requirements, quality standards, pre-commit checklist
- [Data Transforms](./data-transforms.md) — Full pipeline from BenchmarkRow to RenderableGraph: type hierarchy, hardware key construction, derived metrics, memoization strategy
- [State Ownership](./state-ownership.md) — Which context owns which state, availability filtering cascade, comparison date mechanics, URL param sync
- [Blog](./blog.md) — MDX content system, SEO features (OG images, RSS, llms.txt, JSON-LD), TOC sidebar, reading progress, heading links, analytics events
- [Dev Environment](./dev-environment.md) — Isolated `dev`-branch stack on `:8080`: push-to-deploy flow, manual data ingest, where to look, prod-isolation guarantees
